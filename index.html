  Building systems in proof assistants is challenging for many reasons.
  Such systems must tolerate changes gracefully: definitions may be
  optimized for performance, new theorems may be added, and the proof
  assistant itself may change how tactics work. Proof assistants are also
  highly expressive; engineers must ensure that their specifications do not
  accidentally allow for undesirable behavior. Furthermore, large-scale
  developments often depend on good tactic performance, requiring
  developers to reason about low-level performance costs.

  <p>
  To help address these challenges, the

  (PE) project is collecting best
  practices and building techniques and tools for developing large systems in
  the demanding and foundational context of proof assistants.
