  Building systems in proof assistants is challenging for many reasons.
  Such systems must tolerate changes gracefully: definitions may be
  optimized for performance, new theorems may be added, and the proof
  assistant itself may change how tactics work. Proof assistants are also
  highly expressive; engineers must ensure that their specifications do not
  accidentally allow for undesirable behavior. Furthermore, large-scale
  developments often depend on good tactic performance, requiring
  developers to reason about low-level performance costs.

  To help address these challenges, the

  (PE) project is collecting best
  practices and building techniques and tools for developing large systems in
  the demanding and foundational context of proof assistants.
