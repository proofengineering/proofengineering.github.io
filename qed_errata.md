# Explanations

<a name="exp1">1</a>: The universe polymorphism algorithm in Coq that we cite is based on [Type Checking with Universes](https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-3975(90)90108-T) by Robert Harper and Randy Pollack. The DOI that we link to was published in 1991, though the algorithm surfaced in a draft from 1989 that is also available online [here](https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-50940-2_39).
